    <!--
   1, AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.
      
    What is AJAX?

AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

AJAX is not a programming language.

AJAX just uses a combination of:

    A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
    JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

   2, Modern Browsers can use Fetch API instead of the XMLHttpRequest Object.

The Fetch API interface allows web browser to make HTTP requests to web servers.

If you use the XMLHttpRequest Object, Fetch can do the same in a simpler way.

//The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to exchange data with a web server behind the scenes.
//syntax to create XMLHttpRequest Object
variable = new XMLHttpRequest();

//Define a Callback Function

A callback function is a function passed as a parameter to another function.
//syntax
xhttp.onload = function() {
  // What to do when the response is ready
}

//Check the status of the request

  200 → ok

  201 → created

  301 → moved permanently or redirected

  400 → bad request

  403 → forbidden

  404 → file not found

  500 → server crash 

//Send a Request

To send a request to a server, you can use the open() and send() methods of the XMLHttpRequest object:
xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt",true);
xhttp.send(); 

// 
GET or POST?

GET is simpler and faster than POST, and can be used in most cases.

However, always use POST requests when:

    A cached file is not an option (update a file or database on the server).
    Sending a large amount of data to the server (POST has no size limitations).
    Sending user input (which can contain unknown characters), POST is more robust and secure than GET.
